# Eat-Da-Burger
This is a really fun application where I've created a burger logger with MySql, Node, Express, and Handlebars. The application allows you to enter in new burgers which will be stored in our MySql database. There is a *Devour It* button if you're hungry and a *Cook It* button if you want seconds!<br><br> <img src="public/assets/img/directory.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 250px; float: left;" /> 

The filepath for this project is quite involved as you can see here. The config directory is where we create our connection to our MySql database. The orm.js file is where we create the methods that will execute the necessary MySQL commands in the controllers. Inside the burger controller.js file we create the code that will call the ORM functions using burger specific input for the ORM. This is exported at the end of the file with a module.exports. Our db directory houses the code for MySql. We have several depndencies saved in our package.json, including body-parser, express, express-handlebars, method-override, mysql, and path. Our views directory contains what our user sees when the site is deployed on our server. The main.handlebars takes in the html from our index.handlebars file using handlebars.
